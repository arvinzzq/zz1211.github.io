// 计算一个字符串长度
/**
 * This property returns the number of code units in the string.UTF-16, the string
 * format used by JavaScript, uses a single 16-bit code unit to represent the most
 * common characters, but needs to use two code units for less commonly-used characters,
 * so it's possible for the value returned by length to not match the actual number of
 * characters in the string.
